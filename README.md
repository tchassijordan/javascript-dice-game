# Dice Game

Heyo, Here I created a dual player dice game using javascript. I also used the browser's built-in ```localStorage``` to persist my game's data since it's very little.

### How to play 
- The game start's when a player rolls the dice for the first time, his score is recorded and counter passes to the next player.

- The first player to get a __score: 20__ or __above__ wins the round.

- The nnumber of rounds each player has won can be resetted using the __Reset Rounds__ button.

- A record of the number of rounds each player has won is shown in the __highest score__ section.
